Before running the setup scripts, please do the following:

1) Set up and configure the chef server.  
2) Set up one or more nodes to function as members of a solr cluster.
3) Configure passwordless ssh between the workstation and the chef server as the chef user.
4) Edit the file "solr_cluster_nodes", putting each node's fqdn on one line.
5) Modify the values in the file "chef_dev_env.sh" according to your workstation and chef server configuration. 
6) Add all hosts (chef server and nodes) to /etc/hosts.

Run the setup scripts in the following order to configure the workstation and bootstrap a solr cluster with chef:

restore_untracked.sh
bootstrap_solr_cluster.sh
